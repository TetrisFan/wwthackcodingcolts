***** CONCERNS *****
- font-family Karla does not have a thinner font-weight

***** GENERAL TASKS *****
- change the fonts to a thinner font weight
- link pages to each other
- override bootstrap's button's active/hover states
  (when you click on some of the buttons, there's a split second where it
  turns into a different color.)
- organize messy css stylesheet
  (styling general elements [the red words] at the top, class styles in order of
  page organization, duplicated css styles need to be shortened, go back and
  replace unnecessary code with bootstrap classes)
